# spring-mvc-crud
- In this project, I have initialized libraries such as Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot DevTools, Thymeleaf, and the MySQL Driver to manipulate the project. 
- After initializing the project, I create packages such as Controller, Dao, Entity, Exception, and Service to contain the corresponding classes. In addition, I also configure the application.properties file to connect to the database. 
- In the entity package, I created a class named Employee and used the @Entity annotation to mark this class, and @Table matches the table name in the database. There are also other annotations for the fields.
- Then I created an interface class in the dao package. In this class, I use JPARepository to manipulate add, delete, edit, and read API.
- Then I created an interface class (EmployeeService) and a class (EmployeeServiceImpl). In interface class, I write methods and in class, I create method from interface class. Then I use @Service annotation and declare an interface class (from dao package) to add, remove, edit, and read API methods. 
- Then I created an class in the controller package and use  @Controller and @RequestMapping annotations. Then declare the interface class (EmployeeService) and instantiate the constructor with arguments, then use the @Autowired annotation for injection. Then I call the method from the interface class that has been handled by the class (EmployeeServiceImpl).
   + listEmployees method: This method handles the GET request for "/list" URL. It retrieves a list of employees from the employeeService and adds it to the model attribute "employees". It then returns the view name "employees/list-employees", which will be used to render the list of employees.
   + addEmployee method: This method handles the GET request for "/showFormForAdd" URL. It creates a new instance of the Employee class, adds it to the model attribute "employee", and returns the view name "employees/employee-form". This view will be used to display the form for adding a new employee.
   + saveEmployee method: This method handles the POST request for "/save" URL. It receives the form data for the employee through the @ModelAttribute annotation and saves the employee using the employeeService. After saving, it redirects the user to the "/list" URL to display the updated list of employees.
   + updateEmployee method: This method handles the GET request for "/showFormForUpdate" URL. It receives the employee ID as a request parameter and uses it to retrieve the corresponding employee from the employeeService. The retrieved employee is added to the model attribute "employee", and the view name "employees/employee-form" is returned. This view will be used to display the form for updating the employee.
   + deleteEmployee method: This method handles the GET request for "/delete" URL. It receives the employee ID as a request parameter and uses it to delete the corresponding employee using the employeeService. After deletion, it redirects the user to the "/list" URL to display the updated list of employees.
- Once done, I created an index.html class in the resources/static directory and navigated to list-employees.html in the resources/templates.employees directory.
   + In the file list-employees.html, I declared an xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org" that allows you to use the special attributes and syntax of Thymeleaf by adding the th: prefix to HTML attributes. Also I use Bootstrap 5 for css.
   + In the file employee-form.html, Similar to the file list-employees.html I declare and use bootstrap 5 to css.
